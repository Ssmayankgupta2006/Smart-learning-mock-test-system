# Online mock test system
<br>
I developed my first project using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap focusing on creating a dynamic and interactive online mock test system. The primary goal of the project is to provide students with a platform to practice and evaluate their knowledge through various mock tests.

**Key Features:**
1. **User Authentication:** A secure login and registration system that allows users to create accounts and access personalized dashboards.
2. **Test Creation:** Administrators can create and manage tests, including adding questions, setting time limits, and specifying test parameters.
3. **Question Bank:** A comprehensive question bank with various question types (multiple choice, true/false, short answer) to provide a diverse testing experience.
4. **Responsive Design:** The system is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal usability across different devices and screen sizes.
5. **Timer and Navigation:** A countdown timer for each test session, along with easy navigation between questions.
6. **Real-time Results:** Instant feedback and detailed results analysis, including scores, correct and incorrect answers, and overall performance metrics.
7. **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, clear instructions, and visually appealing design elements.
8. **Backend Management:** An efficient backend using PHP and MySQL to handle user data, test information, and result storage securely.

**Technologies Used:**
- **PHP:** Server-side scripting language to manage backend logic and database interactions.
- **MySQL:** Database management system to store user data, test information, and results.
- **HTML/CSS:** Frontend technologies to structure and style the user interface, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience.
- **JavaScript:** Enhancing interactivity and providing real-time feedback during test sessions.

**Challenges and Learnings:**
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into full-stack development, particularly in handling data securely, optimizing performance, and creating a user-centric experience. The project also enhanced my problem-solving skills and reinforced my understanding of web technologies.
